## About

This was inspired by a class assignment where we had to create a hashtag for an algorithm that uses sentiment analysis on a list of movie reviews. When the user inputs a review, it will return whether the user input is a positive or negative remark. For the assignment, we only had to create the hashtag, the algorithm was already given. So I decided to create this from scratch with my spin on it. 

The web scrapers mainly scrap off reviews from Yelp where the rating and the actual review are documented in a text file and used in the sentimental analysis algorithm.
